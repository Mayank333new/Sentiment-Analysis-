Good morning,
Respected Principal Sir, respected teachers and my dear colleagues,
Today we all have gathered here on a great occasion—2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti. On this day, we remember Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation of India, who is known all over the world for his non-violent struggles and policies of truth.
Gandhi Ji's Early Life and Birth:
Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2nd October, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat. His full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. His father's name was Karamchand Gandhi and mother's name was Putlibai. Karamchand Gandhi was the Diwan of Porbandar, while Putlibai was a religious and philanthropic woman. His mother's religious and simplicity-filled life had a deep impact on Gandhi Ji's personality.
Education and Foreign Travel:
Gandhi Ji completed his early education in Porbandar and Rajkot. Later, he went to London, where he studied law. In 1888, he enrolled in England and became a barrister. There too, he was known for his simplicity and self-restraint in life. After completing his education, Gandhi returned to India and started practicing law, but he did not get much success in this field.
Struggle in South Africa:
Gandhi's real political life started when he went to South Africa in 1893. There he faced apartheid for the first time. This incident became a turning point in his life. He fought for the rights of the Indians there and started the Satyagraha movement. It was a method of non-violent resistance, which later became the main weapon of India's freedom struggle.
Freedom struggle in India:
After returning to India in 1915, Gandhi started fighting against British rule. His first major movement was the Champaran Satyagraha, which started in 1917. Here he raised his voice against the British after seeing the plight of the farmers. After this, in 1920 he started the Non-Cooperation Movement, in which people were appealed to do non-cooperation against the British rule.
In 1930, Gandhi ji did the Dandi March, in which he protested against the salt law. This march started on 12 March 1930 and lasted for 24 days. This event created awareness across the country against the British government.
In 1942, Gandhi ji led the Quit India Movement, in which he clearly said that now the British should leave India. This movement proved to be the last step towards the independence of India.
Path of non-violence and truth:
Gandhi ji's life was completely based on non-violence and truth. He never resorted to violence in his life and always walked on the path of truth. He believed that any problem or conflict can be solved without violence, if people move forward with truth and patience.
His famous line was: “Give me blood, I will give you freedom,” which he said to inspire the youth of India.
Death of Gandhi and his legacy:
Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948. His death was a great loss for India, but his ideas and principles are still alive today. Gandhi taught us that there is no greater power than truth, non-violence, and restraint.
Today, we draw inspiration from Gandhi’s life that we should work with truth and integrity to serve our country. His ideas and his ideals will always be inspirational for us.
Conclusion:
Today, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, we should pledge to follow his ideals. Only by following the path of truth and non-violence can we build a better society. Let us all together contribute to building the India of Gandhi’s dreams.
Thank you.
